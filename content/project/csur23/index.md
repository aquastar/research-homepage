title: Bridging the Gap between Spatial and Spectral Domains - A Unified Framework for Graph Neural Networks
summary: Deep learning's performance has been extensively recognized recently. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to deal with graph-structural data that classical deep learning does not easily manage.Since most GNNs were created using distinct theories, direct comparisons are impossible. Prior research has primarily concentrated on categorizing existing models, with little attention paid to their intrinsic connections. The purpose of this study is to establish a unified framework that integrates GNNs based on spectral graph and approximation theory. The framework incorporates a strong integration between spatial- and spectral-based GNNs while tightly associating approaches that exist within each respective domain.

This research aims to provide a coherent framework for generalizing GNNs by bridging the divide between seemingly unrelated works in the spatial and spectral domains, as well as by linking methods within each domain.
The study will build a unified theoretical framework that encompasses diverse GNNs. Our research is novel in that it connects disparate GNN models, allowing for direct rethinking and comparison of all GNN models.
