**Course-Track or Project-Track M.S.**

If you are doing a course-track MS degree and want to include me as a major professor, follow the general suggestion on the slides/presentation. 
- The exam typically lasts one hour, with 30-40 minutes for presentation and the remaining 20-30 minutes for Q&A. 
- Invite the professors who previously taught you as instructors to the committee and select their courses to present as your main contents. 
- One reasonable content distribution is around 10 slides for each course, for a total of 30 slides, plus around 3 slides before that as an introduction, and one slide at the end.

**Course Override**

If a course is full and you still desire to enroll, check with your major professor or department to see if your registration has been released. Then submit your override requests at the following web address: https://www.cse.msstate.edu/capacity-override-request-form/
