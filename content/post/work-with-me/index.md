**Course-Track M.S.**

If you are doing a course-track MS degree and want to include me as a major professor, follow the general suggestion on the slides/presentation. 

* The exam typically lasts one hour, with 30-40 minutes for presentation and the remaining 20-30 minutes for Q&A. 
* Invite the professors who previously taught you as instructors to the committee and select their courses to present as your main content. 
* One reasonable content distribution is around 10 slides for each course, for a total of 30 slides, plus around 3 slides before that as an introduction, and one slide at the end.
* Request feedback on slides from all committee members 1-2 weeks prior to the exam
* Schedule a meeting with the committee members one to two months prior to the exam, and allow approximately two weeks for selection using [Doodle](doodle.com) or [when2meet](when2meet.com).

**Project-Track** M.S.

* replace the course-related content above with your project content.
