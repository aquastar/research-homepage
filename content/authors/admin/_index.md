I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Mississippi State University. Before joining MS State in 2020, I worked as a research assistant at Virginia Tech. I am now working on `machine learning`, with a particular emphasis on graph/network problems such as `graph flow`, see \[my research interest]({{< relref "/post/research-interest" >}}).
