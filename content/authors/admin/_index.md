I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Mississippi State University. Before joining MS State in 2020, I have been working as a research assistant at Virginia Tech. I am now working on machine learning over graphs/networks, with a particular emphasis on **network flow** problems, see [my research interest]({{< relref "/post/research-interest" >}}. {{% staticref "/post/research-interest" "newtab" %}}Download my CV{{% /staticref %}}
