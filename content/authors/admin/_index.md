I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Mississippi State University. Before joining MS State in 2020, I have been working as a research assistant at Virginia Tech. I am now working on machine learning over graphs/network problems, with a particular emphasis on `network flow` problems, see [my research interest]({{< relref "/post/research-interest" >}}).
